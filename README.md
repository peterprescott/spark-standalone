# Big Data Analysis using Spark

This is my project file for Assignment 1 of [COMP529](https://intranet.csc.liv.ac.uk/teaching/modules/module.php?code=COMP529), which  requires the configuration of a Spark standalone cluster, and then the implementation of some specified data analysis on a table of coronavirus data (see [task description](A1.pdf)).
